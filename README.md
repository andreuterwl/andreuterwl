👋🏻👦🏻 Hi, I’m @andreuterwl.  

Currently doing my doctoral studies at the Universitat de València, where I have a university teacher training contract (FPU) for the development of my doctoral thesis and the first teaching tasks. My interests are party governments, coalitions, parliaments, and political elites. In terms of techniques, I have devoted time to statistical and network analysis.
